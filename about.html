<h2>About</h2>
	
<p>Starting in the fall of 2013, the Wunderman Interns Now (WIN) Program launched with a singular goal: connecting students with professionals and resources to provide individualized work experiences. Since that first semester of just three interns, our program has expanded to provide not just internships for students, but also resume workshops, industry meet-and-greets, mock interviews, and much more.</p>

<p>During each fall, spring, and summer semester, the WIN Program averages close to ten interns between our two offices in Houston and Dallas. Our interns work directly with client data in a variety of different disciplines, including Service Management, Production, Quality Control, Delivery Scheduling, and more. In our Dallas office, interns may also have the opportunity to work in our Analytics, Finance, and Human Resource departments.</p>

<p>For each intern, the WIN Program is proud to offer:</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>24 hours of work a week within a flexible schedule that fits around your availability</li>
	<li>An assigned mentor to provide a go-to, personal connection within the company (most mentors were interns themselves!)</li>
	<li>On-the-job training in both one-on-one and open learning environments</li>
	<li>Work with real client data for actual client deliverables</li>
	<li>Regular progress checks to keep you on track for a job, including resume workshops near the end of the internship</li>
	<li>Opportunities to branch off into different concentrations within the Wunderman network as the internship progresses</li>
</ul></p>

<p>At Wunderman, we are looking for those people who are proactive, willing to learn, able to wear many hats, and ready to take chances when they come knocking. Think you have what it takes? Then we hope you apply so you too canâ€¦</p>
